# Capstone Project 1: Predicting MLB Players Salary 

## Background/Context

Throughout the years MLB teams have lost enormous amounts of money by overpaying for  players. There have also been many contract signings where players have been totally undervalued.

## The Goal

In this project, I plan to build a model to predict player salaries which can be used both by sports franchises, to minimize their risk, and by players, to help them determine their value. The aim for this project is to accurately predict the salaries for MLB players based on previous season stats, position, age, and length in the MLB.

## The Audience 

Professional baseball players, Major League Baseball teams, sports agents and fans.
